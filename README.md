# File reader powerd by ( Ahmed abd el salam )

####  You can read almost any file except Microsoft family files.
######## but make sure the file has read permission.

## Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.)

```bash
quasar dev
```

### Don't forget to add your domain in src/boot/axios.js

```bash
const local = 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/'
const serve = 'http://143.198.169.92/api/'
const url = local
```

### Build the app for production
